<h3>Challenge</h3>

<h3>Research</h3>
<h5>REI.com users want to belong to a community that is passionate about the outdoors.</h5>
<p>I interviewed several REI customers who had shopped both online and in stores over the last few months. Why did they choose REI? How did they find what they were looking for? Why would they choose to shop online vs. in person? I wanted to discover customer attitudes and behaviors before, during, and after purchase.</p>
<p>I took those findings and made an empathy map to get a sense of who I was designing for—the outdoorsy type whose REI purchases are sparked by passion and a sense of belonging, both to nature and the community of people who join on their adventures.</p>

<h5>REI.com includes lots of experience-focused content, but it’s partitioned from the ecommerce user flow.</h5>
<p>An audit of REI’s current website revealed a huge amount of content to support its customers’ adventures, including expert advice, ideas for local excursions, and guided expeditions around the world. The ecommerce experience was well designed but failed to incorporate any features that felt like the in-store experience.</p>
