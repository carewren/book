<h3>Step 1: Contextual Inquiry</h3>
<p>You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We'll put a happy little sky in here.</p>

<p>You can do it. Very easy to work these to death. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. See there how easy that is. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Ignore the Screen</h3>
<p>You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We'll put a happy little sky in here.</p>

<p>We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Let's do that again. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.
Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Have fun with it. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Bring Insights into UI</h3>
<p>You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We'll put a happy little sky in here.</p>
