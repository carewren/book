<h3>Challenge</h3>
<h5>How could Apple refine its iOS Contacts app to optimize accessibility under A11Y guidelines?</h5>
<p>The iPhone is already the preferred mobile platform for visually impaired users, thanks to Apple’s attention to accessibility best practices and its robust screen reader, VoiceOver. Explore the iOs Contacts app and identify opportunities to optimize the experience for users who rely on VoiceOver to navigate their phones.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<h5>Screen readers require users to sift through a huge volume of content.</h5>
<p>I began the research process with <strong>contextual inquiry</strong>, both in person and via video, observing visually impaired users as they navigated their phones with VoiceOver. The users almost always completed tasks and navigated through user flows as quickly or more so than non-impaired users. They dialed up the speed of the screen reader and were able to process content and take actions extremely quickly. Due to the huge amount of spoken content, users appreciated experiences that were streamlined and direct.</p>
<p>Next, I went into my own iPhone’s settings and activated VoiceOver for a <strong>context of use analysis</strong>. For 2 days, I navigated my phone with VoiceOver, noting how gesture-based interactions changed and learning how affordances were communicated.</p>
<h4>Minimum accessibility requirements aren’t good enough.</h4>
<h3>Step 2: Ignore the Screen</h3>
<p>You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We'll put a happy little sky in here.</p>

<p>We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Let's do that again. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.
Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Have fun with it. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Bring Insights into UI</h3>
<p>You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We'll put a happy little sky in here.</p>
