<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>Design a contacts app for visually impaired users who rely on iOS VoiceOver to navigate their screen.</p>
<h3>My Role</h3>
<p>UX Design / Content Strategy / Wireframes / Visual Design</p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>Pencil &amp; paper / Spreadsheet / Sketch / Photoshop / After Effects</p>

<h3>Step 1: Contextual Inquiry</h3>
<p>You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.

<p>You can do it. Very easy to work these to death. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. See there how easy that is. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.</p>
